'This page is used to clean up any Crystal Reports RDC Runtime objects remaining in a
'a user's session.  This page is called by a new browser window that is launched when
'a user closes a browser window containing a Crystal Reports viewer.
'
'You want to make sure that you clean up any instances of the oApp, oRpt and oPageEngine
'objects for 2 reasons:
'1) Licensing
'2) Resources
'When you create an instance of the Application and Report objects you are using
'an RDC Runtime license.  Once you hit your maximum concurrent users (all licenses in use)
'you will no longer be able to create an instance of the report object (session("oRpt")
'Thus, when a user closes his/her browser you want to make sure that user's session is
'terminated as quickly as possible so that their license can be reclaimed.
'By destroying the session objects you are also reclaiming memory.
